So I am suffering from dry eyes lately and I figured that one way to deal with it is to set all my working environment with dark themes. That indeed provides some level of relief. This is a series,  starting with TexStudio, as right now I am grinding to get a paper published.

1. TexStudio --> Option --> Save Profile to backup:

```
"User/Appdata/Roaming/texstudio/txs_default.txsprofile"
```

2. Copy and rename it to txs_costom.tesprofile.

3. Download DarkTheme which was supposed to be a .txt file from, for instance, [this](https://github.com/Francis-Hsu/TeXstudio_Solarized).

4. Copy and paste the whole file into the bottom of txs_costom.tesprofile.

5. TexStudio --> Option --> Load Profile and restart TexStudio. Here is what it looks like.

ENJOY!
