So I am suffering from dry eyes lately and I figured that one way to deal with it is to set all my working environment with dark themes. That indeed provides some level of relief. This is a series,  starting with TexStudio, as right now I am grinding to get a paper published.

Step 1: TexStudio --> Option --> Save Profile and save a profile to a directory you remember. For me, I just saved it to the default config directory:

"User/Appdata/Roaming/texstudio/txs_default.txsprofile"

Step 2: Make a copy and name it to whatever you like. For me, it is just txs_costom.tesprofile.

Step 3: Download DarkTheme which was supposed to be a .txt file yet WordPress does not allow such format. Other themes can be found, for instance, this link.

Step 4: Copy and paste the whole file into the bottom of txs_costom.tesprofile.

Step 5: TexStudio --> Option --> Load Profile and restart TexStudio. Here is what it looks like.

ENJOY!
