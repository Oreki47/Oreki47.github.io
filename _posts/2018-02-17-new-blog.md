I used to have my blog set up on WordPress and decided to migrate to github page for several reasons. I foud the text editor a bit annoying on the WordPress, for instance, when I want to type some equation, or code. Maybe I am just not very familiar to it. But I am more comfortable with Markdown for sure. Also, github page is free. 

I have never used ruby before, and building up a blog is for sure not a good way to learn it. But who cares. I have managed to have most of the things I want in several hours. Although there are some glitches, I am sure I will figure this out gradually. Anyway, this is a good start. I will move my blog post gradually, manually, as there are only 20 of them. And I cannot install plugins, since I am using a personal plan.

That's it.
