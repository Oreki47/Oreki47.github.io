So I have roughly two more years for my Ph.D. Now I am a bit nervous as I just finished my first Journal writing and is about to have it submitted. There is no way I could know if it will get accepted. To reach the average bar of our lab, I need 2 journals and 4 conferences in total. Now I only have one conference (although conferences are, indeed, easy and take roughly 1 month with a good idea in mind).

In retrospect, I made a few mistakes during building up this model and running the experiments.

First I did not have a very clear vision of what components are needed. I understand that when you are new to a field, it is very difficult to come up with everything correct at the very beginning. So to solve the problems, I should have kept trying, defining the tasks and think about components needed. With the first time choking all the way through, I believe now I have a better idea of how things go. I would try to be more efficient, either consciously or unconsciously

Second, I always stopped when I got a little bit of result, and think about coming back to extend it later. This, as it turned out, is a very bad habit, since some of the times we would believe our model to have some certain behaviors, but it is a different thing to create a well-enough figure to illustrate such behaviors. And therefore this should be done before I start writing the paper itself.

Finally, I think I am not very enthusiastic about digging deep, as I always have this fear of what if my model does not work, or what if it does not provide the answer I expect, and therefore spent too much time wandering. I think the coding itself is not very time consuming, as most of the time I can fix or add new features within several hours. If I could push myself to grind a little bit harder, I would say I could be way more efficient than now.

I already have an idea in my mind. This has not been addressed before. I would need to define a few components that could be mathematically expressed (which is necessary for a scientific paper to make it look professional) and start building up the model now. I am really looking forward to it. This will be a conference material and I plan to spend a month for this. Still, I have not defined the tasks yet. Let's see if there is enough room to make it also a journal. I am looking forward to it.

That's all about paper writing. As a Ph.D., I still have other tasks. I would like to spend some time reviewing convex optimization as I believe this would be extremely useful for my later life and I would like to start reading the book about statistical learning. However, How am I going to have time for all of them? I am constantly in the stage of planning too much and later on, I just figured I have already given out everything I have. Of course, I can always ask myself to work harder. But I am already working 50+ hours a week and I really don't know, how am I suppose to work harder. And I am not taking about 9-5 as 8 hours. I am using rescue time to effectively track my usage of time. When I have 50+ hours on the system, it means I spent at least 60+ at work. I guess I will have to compromise and set up priority for my summer.

There are a few thingsI would like to do and have to do during the summer,

A conference paper with EV (HIGH, finish it before the start of Aug).
A review of Convex Optimization (Low, treat it as a reference book).
Read statistical learning book (Medium, as I want to systematically go over methods and algorithms in the mainstream).
Read and code Python 4 data analysis (Medium, as this is a reference book. But I really want to learn some cool stuff in the book).
Go through some basic examples on SK-learn (Low, this should be in conjunction with the statistical book as solely looking and rewriting them does no help at all. I will simply forget them after a few weeks).
Complete a competition on Kaggle (Medium, better get me into the battleground early).
Looking at potential corps and internship opportunities for next summer (Low, this is a bit early, but I should start paying attention. I want to have a file of potential positions I would like to get and their requirements so I can customize my skill tree towards them).
Above are mainly stuff related to my career. I also want to do a couple things that are off-work,

Calligraphy (I just find it interesting, let's make it a new habit).
Reading books (As I would start driving to school, I lose roughly one hour on the bus reading, I am thinking using night time from 10-11, as most of the time I would just be watching video clips on youtube).
Running (Spend 1 hour checking out systematic training methods and plan for 10 km this winter. There is no need to rush 20).
I know I may be pushing myself a bit too much, but I have wasted too much time on games and others and I am sure I will keep on wasting time on them. Actually, I do not see them a waste of time because I simply need watching stream and clips to release my stress. This is how I sustain my stressful life (or just an excuse for laziness). Anyway, timing-wise I do not think I can commit substantially more so I should think about efficiency and how to utilize fragments of time. I believe there are a couple things that are suitable for fill in the slots. And I should start trying them out. It's easier said than done. Otherwise, everyone will be successful.


Edit on 02/25/2018 -- Turns out I need 3 years to finish my Ph.D. back then, which means I still have roughly 2 to go.
