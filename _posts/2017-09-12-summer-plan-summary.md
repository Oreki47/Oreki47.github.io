So I guess the summer is almost over. Now I can check if I have accomplished what I planed at the very beginning of the summer.

So I did finish a conference paper within 30 days. That's good, although according to my plan I should have spent my July working on it. I got caught up by revising my journal paper and instead the conference got warped up during August. This is not too bad.

I did not spend any time on convex optimization,  or ESL, or Python 4 data analysis. And of course, I did not go through SK-learn. However, I did complete a competition on Kaggle.

Oh, and I did not spend any time on potential corps. F**k it, I am not worried about my jobs anymore.

So 2 out of 7, I guess that was fine. The main problem is I spent too much time working on my journal paper and it took way longer than I thought (the whole June and half of July). However, now I have a better understanding of how things work and should give out a better estimate. What about off-work stuff?

I did spend a lot of time on calligraphy, which is nice. I like writing everything down on a paper. Instead of reading randomly, I spent most of my reading time on the Bible, so I guess this is also fine. Finally, I stopped running, simply because summer was too hot. Let's catch up during the fall. That being said, I kept working out during the summer and I can feel that I have more body strength than before.

I would say I have spent a meaningful summer with, expected, ups and downs. I believe I am in a very good mental state and physical shape that would be very helpful to carry me through my last two years of Ph.D. life.
